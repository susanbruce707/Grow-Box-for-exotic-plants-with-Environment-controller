# This project I built for a friend of mine called Tomas, he loves growing exotic plants and wanted a controlled environment to do this but could not afford the high prices (Â£100's) of a commercially build item.
# This project is a very simple build using easy to obtain items.
# List of parts
# Arduino Nano v3
# Real Time Clock Module for Arduino
# LCD 16x2 display with i2C connection 
# 4 momentary push button switches
# 3 or 4 units, Mains switching, 5 volt powered, Relay module for Arduino
# DHT22 Humidity and Temperature sensor module for Arduino
# 3-24 volt to 5 volt DC to DC buck converter
# An old phone charger of similar with 7 volt or more DC output at approx 500-1000 ma rated current output
# An old simple computer fan 5 volt or similar
# Two mains powered LED grow lights
# One snake heater light approx 100 watts
# Heated waterproof seed germination mat
# An old shelve from a fridge or similar
# A plastic storage container big enough to fit grow lights, snake heater, fridge shelve and room for how ever many plants or some similar container
# Some panels of thin plywood for sliding doors
# A small plastic box (I used old ice-cream container) to put Arduino and associated parts in
# Twin flex mains cable for lights and heater etc
# Small prototyping board to mount Arduino and components on
# soldering iron and solder plus a few tools for assembly of project
